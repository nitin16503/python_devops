# Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used for performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
print (3/2) # 1.5 
print (3//2)# 1
print (5%3) # 2

# Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They include the equal sign (=) and various compound assignment operators.
a=1
a+=2
a-=2

# Relational Operators: Relational operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. They return a Boolean result (True or False).
x=2
y=3
print(x>y) #false
print(x>=y) #false
print(x<y)  #true
print(x<=y) #true
print(x==2) #true 


# Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combine and manipulate Boolean values. They include "and," "or," and "not."
t = True
f = False
print (t and f ) #false
print (t or f)   # true
print (not f)    # true 

# Identity Operators: Identity operators are used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory. The identity operators in Python are "is" and "is not.
a=5
b=5
print (a is b ) #True
print (a is not b)#False
