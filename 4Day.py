# In devops we use common machine and different projects require diffrent verions of packages. 
# For solving this problem we require virtual environment. For each project you create virtual environment which act as a seperate machine.

#  HOW TO DO?
#  1st -> pip install virtualenv
#  2nd -> python -m venv PROJET_NAME     (create seperated machine(virtual environment) with project PROJECT_NAME )
#  3rd -> source PROJECT_NAME/bin/activate  (enter the virtual environment)
#  4th -> deactivate     (exit virtul environment)
